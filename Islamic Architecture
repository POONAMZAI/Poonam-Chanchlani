<h3 style="color:rgb(125, 213, 235)";><strong> From Spirituality to Art...</strong></h3>


<p style="background-color:SlateBlue";>The Creator of this universe and the worlds beyond our sight has blessed us with everything we see around us, infact the eyes too, with which we can look around. As humans, as very vulnerable, love-seeking creatures, we discovered this blessing of having an urge to connect with our Lord, our Creator, our Sustainer.

With each passing day, our death slides nearer and nearer,we are left with a very less time for being able to thank our Sustainer, the only immortal power we know, which we couldn't even know fully in this world of traps of temporary pleasure. 

We,sacks of dust and emotions are even having this fortune of knowing about the ways in which we can thank and praise our Lord. Don't we, most of the time, forget to thank Him for what we have? Don't we think, how praying five times a day is not a daily chore as we do it but, our daily life need just like oxygen?

The oxygen is what keeps us standing in this world and Namaz is what will make our legs straight and  shiver less on <i>Qiyamah</i>?

Our hands can pray wherever because he is everywhere!BUT, can we, sacks of dust and emotions, really feel him and his blessings everywhere? These questions will get answered only when one starts breathing with a 'Thank you god!/Alhamdulillah!', and still we won't be able to thank our Sustainer,The Most Kind enough!!

</p>

<p style="background-color:SlateBlue";>We,the dust sacks with a lot of emotions, try to remind each other about his existence, his love, his fear through his sent Books as 'Guidance' and art. We write long poems to describe our love for our Creator to the people, so they get out of the slave worship like <i>Mewlana Jalalluddin Rumi</i>.


we also try to paint our imagination on walls and carve on stones and marbles to remind each other that you were, without asking, gifted those eyes, with which you adore this worldly life and temporary beauty and with your insight, you ignore the eternal bliss you will be in forever if you praise your Lord for what he has favoured upon you.

<p style="background-color:Pink";> "...And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful." [ Quran 14:34]<br>
"...and what all favours of your Lord will you deny?"[Quran 55:13]

<h3 style="color:rgb(125, 213, 235)";>Environment Stimulates the Love and Greatfulness...</h3>


<img src="https://www.worldfortravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Iran-Mosque-Nasir-al-Mulk.jpg" alt="IRAN" width=800 length=800>


<p><cite>Nasir Al-Molk Masjid</cite>, Shiraz, Iran.</p>

<p style="background-color:slateblue;">The way your room smells and the way it looks not only manipulates your mind and mood but it also gives you different vibes and is also a cause of your mood swings. The mosque shown above is a perfect example how a muslim looking at the colours, the divinity, the beauty can be encouraged to pray. Here, I will mention less about the tourism factor. 
The way the colourful lights will touch your face, it will give you a slight new experience while bowing down in front of your lord, only when you see it that way. If your eyes distract you from praying to look at the colorful lights then neither the environment nor your insight can save you from drowning. Similarly, if you really want to pray and you don't do it as your daily chore but like breathing and having food, then doesn't matter what all distractions you have, you will sail and sail well.
The love for your lord should be greater than any love, distraction or trauma. Your love can never question the Lord for the trials, for the trauma you suffer in this world even after being enough greatful(which you will never be able to).
The way you worship the most loving, the most kind, it should be something that could never be affected by any calamity, discomfort or any amount of distractions. Many few humans were too privileged to attain this level of spirituality but, it's not something impossible to attain. Though, we should and we must pray more to our lord to grant us this privilege to become better versions of ourselves everyday for the sake of his love and for the sake of his eternal bliss which we plan to dwell in forever.
The art which sometimes compell and other times encourage to take our prayer mats, leave our houses (or not), fill our hearts with joys and <i>imaan</i>.<br>
</p><br>

<h3 style="color: rgb(125, 213, 235);">Mats, Tasbeeh and Turbah matter too...</h3>

<br>

<p style="background-color: slateblue;">How is it that when we bow down to our one and only Lord, we get our obstacles cleared,
we find no worry bigger than this worship and this love, we crave more already with no Mat, laps around but just soil? Getting up to pray or waiting for the time to come to pray is also worship, is also love, is also a way of expressing attachment.
Do the Mats, the lamps hung around, the atmosphere, the rosary <i>(tasbeeh)</i> and the <i>Turbah</i> which we prostrate on has a power of pulling you towards
worship too.<b>Being rich doesn't mean having all of these. Being rich means having enough faith to be pulled to pray with the availible sources.</b> Being blessed with certainity in <i>Imaan</i> is something almost impossible to find in humans. Indeed, we, humans, were created weak.
The <i>tasbeeh</i> you hold, the beads, the colour, the place from where it was bought do matter to an extent.It is also a psychological manipulation of the mind and the actual blessings of ALLAH of the places like Mecca, Medina and Karbala.

<p style="background-color: slateblue; font-size: 24px;">All the worship, alone, is denoted to the creator and none of his creations is worthy of being worshipped. Unlike <i>kuffar</i>. 
This concept of <b>monotheism</b> is unachievable with a stone-like-heart. Hearts can melt through eyes, when the eyes notice the truth, the mighty, the faith and the miraculous healing prostration holds. 
All of this doesn't mean having plastic feelings or showing fake emotions for the sake of fame and popularity. Writing art, building beautiful architecture and reciting poems of love toward the lord should be done solely for the sake of the creator.
Prostration is the placement of the body in a reverentially or submissively prone position as a gesture. Typically prostration is distinguished from the lesser acts of bowing or kneeling by involving a part of the body above the knee touching the ground, especially the hands.
Prostration<i>(sajdah)</i>, is something our souls long for since the last time we prostrated. When your heart, your mind and your soul are just craving for the rememberance of your lord, then you should do abulition<i>(wudhu)</i>, and then wear clean and do prostrate and bow down with humility.</p>
